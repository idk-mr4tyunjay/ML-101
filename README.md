# Machine Learning Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects aimed at helping beginners learn and practice machine learning concepts. Each project is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it ideal for those who are new to machine learning.

## Projects

1. **Linear Regression**: Implement a simple linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its size.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their study hours.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: Use k-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
4. **Decision Trees**: Implement a decision tree classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
5. **Random Forest**: Build a random forest classifier to predict whether a bank customer will default on their loan.
6. **Neural Networks**: Create a basic neural network to classify images of handwritten digits.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you will need Python and several Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the project and understand the code.
